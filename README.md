<h1>Project Description</h1>

In the digital age, social media has become an inseparable part of student life worldwide. While it provides opportunities for communication, learning, and entertainment, excessive use can lead to addiction and negatively impact academics, mental health, and productivity. This project focuses on analyzing Global Student Social Media Usage and Addiction Data using Power BI.
The dataset contains details such as daily usage hours, platforms used, country/region of students, academic performance, and self-reported addiction levels. By analyzing this data, the project provides insights into global patterns of social media usage, highlights signs of addiction, and identifies the impact on students’ lifestyles and studies.

<h1>Objective</h1>

The main objectives of this project are:

  -To analyze average daily time students spend on social media across different regions.

  -To identify which platforms are most popular among students worldwide.

  -To study the correlation between usage hours and addiction levels.

  -To explore the impact of heavy social media use on academic performance.

  -To provide insights that help in designing awareness programs and digital well-being initiatives for students.

<h1>Power BI File</h1>

The Power BI file (Global Student Social Media Usage & Addiction Insights.pbix) contains an interactive dashboard with the following features:

  -Usage Overview: Average daily time spent on social media by students globally.

  -Platform Popularity: Bar and pie charts showing which platforms are most used (e.g., Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.).

  -Addiction Insights: Visuals comparing light, moderate, and high addiction levels among students.

  -Geographic Distribution: Maps displaying regional differences in social media use.

  -Impact Analysis: Correlation between heavy usage and academic performance decline.

  -Demographic Insights: Breakdown of usage based on age groups and gender.

The dashboard allows filtering by platform, country, addiction level, and academic score, making it highly interactive for exploration.

<h1>Results</h1>

The analysis provided several key insights:

  -Students spend an average of 3–5 hours daily on social media, with some reporting over 6 hours.

  -Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok are among the most popular platforms across countries.

  -Students with high usage hours showed stronger signs of addiction, often reporting reduced study time and lower academic performance.

  -Regional differences emerged: in some countries, students use social media more for learning, while in others, entertainment dominates.

  -Addiction levels are higher among younger age groups, with noticeable impacts on sleep and study habits.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

The Global Student Social Media Usage & Addiction Insights project highlights the increasing influence of digital platforms on students’ daily lives. While social media offers benefits, excessive use leads to addiction that impacts academics and well-being.
The Power BI dashboard enables educators, parents, and policymakers to understand global patterns and design interventions. For example, awareness campaigns can target high-risk groups, and schools can encourage balanced digital habits.
Overall, this project demonstrates how data analytics can uncover critical insights about student behavior, helping promote healthier and more productive use of social media worldwide.
